# React Website 'The Poetry Place'
This repo contains code for my final project for the React course run by General Assembly.
- To see the deployment, go [HERE](http://js-ga-assets.s3-website-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/poems)
- This is a work in progress
- Several choices have been made for practice purposes which wouldn't otherwise have been made (e.g. using both local storage and cookies)
- Obviously, a lot of improvements could be made to this site. However, it serves the purpose of demonstrating that I can use React and associated technologies to a reasonable standard.
